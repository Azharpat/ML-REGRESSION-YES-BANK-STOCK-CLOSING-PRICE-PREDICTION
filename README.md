# Yes Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction

The Yes Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction project is aimed at forecasting the closing prices of Yes Bank's stock using various techniques and models. This README provides an overview of the project, the problem statement, and how to use the code and data provided.



## Introduction

The term "YES BANK STOCK CLOSING PRICE PREDICTION" refers to the process of using various methods and techniques to forecast or estimate the closing price of the stock of the company called Yes Bank.

Yes Bank is a well-known Indian private sector bank, and its stock is traded on stock exchanges. The closing price of a stock is the final trading price at which the stock is traded on a particular trading day. The prediction of this closing price involves using historical data, market trends, and various mathematical and statistical models to make an educated guess about what the stock's closing price might be at the end of a given trading day or a specific period in the future.

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task and is usually done by analysts, traders, and researchers who use various methods such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, machine learning algorithms, and other financial models to make their predictions. However, it's important to note that stock price prediction is inherently uncertain and can be affected by various factors, including market sentiment, economic conditions, company performance, and unexpected events.

## Problem Statement

Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stockâ€™s closing price of the month.
